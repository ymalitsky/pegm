# PEGM

This is a supplementary code for the paper "Proximal exrtrapolated gradient methods for variational inequalities"

There are several problems, which are presented in the individual Jupyter (formerly Ipython) Notebook file with extension ipynb. To play with these problems you need Jypyter Notebook to be installed on your computer. Alternatively, you can read these notebooks using http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

Folder `methods` collects two files `algorithms.py` and `algorithms_terminate.py`. The algorithms in both files are almost identical: in the latter the stopping criteria in incorporated, and in the former some energy is computing in every iteration.

Folder `misc` collects 2 files `opt_operators.py`, in which several proximal operators are defined, and `fancy_plots`, which provides a nice plots that were used for publication.
